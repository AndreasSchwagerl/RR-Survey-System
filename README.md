# Web-based Survey System

The purpose of this project is to develop a web-based survey system that handles questions containing both a positive and negative statement. Participants will be given a range of choices pertaining to which statement they most agree with. Each participant will only be able to submit the survey once and their responses will be kept anonymous.

The system will facilitate the breakdown of surveys by department. Reports can then be generated to observe the results for each department and for the company as a whole. This will provide administrators with a way to measure employee satisfaction and concerns.

There is currently no survey system on the market with the above feature set. This project aims to address that hole in the market, providing companies with a way to obtain metrics on performance through a unique approach to questions.

The project will be realized through a combination of web technologies (HTML, CSS) and scripting languages (JavaScript, PHP).
